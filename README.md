# Spotify Nutrition Facts

![Spotify Nutrition Facts Header Image](src/images/nutrition-facts-header-wider.png)

📝 Inspired by [Receiptify](https://receiptify.herokuapp.com/), this app generates an image of the user's Top Tracks and Top Artists based on their Spotify or LastFM listening activity in the style of a Nutrition Facts label. 

💥 Currently, the app is still in development mode with Spotify's web API, which means that I will have to invite your email to the app to be able to connect your account with Spotify. Howeverrr, currently this publicly works with LastFM accounts. Soooo yayyyy!
